# Simple_mcDonald_Menu
This is a straightforward menu for McDonald's that allows the customer to enter the list of food items they wish to order. It then collects all the necessary information, calculates the total amount, and provides the user with the total cost. Additionally, there is an option to include taxes on the total price and display the final amount.
